# locATM

Basic useful feature list:

 * Find ATMs around you
 * Check status of ATM	
 * Share dispensed Notes using App for others to see


LocATM was launched as solution to the long, unending queues at ATMs during the Demoneisation of Currency in 2016 in India.

Standing for hours outside an ATM, only to learn that it was out of funds was a common scenario back then.

The App was quickly hacked together in a day using the Google Maps API and Firebase and was launched on the Google Play store on november 14th and has a Rating of 3.64 and 5000 downloads.
